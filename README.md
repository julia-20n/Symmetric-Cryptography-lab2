## Cryptanalysis of the Vigenere cipher

## Purpose of the work

To learn the methods of frequency cryptanalysis. To acquire skills in working with and analysing additive-type stream ciphers using the Vigenère cipher as an example. 

## Task

Encrypt a text of your choice using the Vigenère cipher with keys of length r = 2-5 and 10-20 characters, and calculate the correspondence indices for the plaintext and all ciphertexts obtained. For options 14 and 18, decrypt the ciphertext, determine the key length, key symbols (by equating the most frequent letters in the block to the most frequent letter in the language and using the function ), and decrypt the text using the found 𝑀𝑖(𝑔) key.
